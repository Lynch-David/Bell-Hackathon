# Bell-Hackathon
Solution to the Bell Hackworks Hackathon 2023

We did the following:
- Login page, homepage, and 2factorauth page (JavaScript, CSS and HTML)
- Wrote JS script to generate random solutions

Ideally our solution would be implemented alongside other forms of user authentication (IP checking, MAC checking).

Better accessibility, clear visuals, geared towards non-tech savvy population. 

Could be employed on sites where children are more suceptable to malicious hackers by using a more enjoyable form of 2FA. Encourages online safety.

Our solution aims to tackle common problems with the current 6 digit 2FA. Remembering 6 digits can be difficult to memorize and 3 attempts can be too little for some. Aims to make it more fun as we move towards using MFA in our daily web browsing. 

We instead have a 4x4 button grid where the user will be sent the solution via email. They need to note the order and the position of 4 buttons.
