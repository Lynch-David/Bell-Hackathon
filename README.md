# Bell-Hackathon
Solution to the Bell Hackworks Hackathon 2023

Our solution aims to tackle common problems with the current 6 digit 2FA. Remembering 6 digits can be difficult to memorize and 3 attempts can be too little for some. Aims to make it more fun as we move towards using MFA in our daily web browsing. 

We instead have a 4x4 button grid where the user will be sent the solution via email. They need to note the order and the position of 4 buttons.
